0.2.2 --> 0.2.3:
* Strip the alpha channel from images before running the OCR. It's basically
  useless and can prevent the tool from working correctly.
* Make hOCR parsing more resistant (handle extra data around box positions)
* Fix: Take into account that new versions of Tesseract uses the file
  extension .hocr instead of .html

0.2.1 --> 0.2.2:
* Fix Python 3 support
* Add support for Tesseract on Heroku

0.2.0 --> 0.2.1:
* Make it possible to use 'import pyocr' instead of 'from pyocr import pyocr'.
  'from pyocr import pyocr' still works but is obsolete.
* Fix dependency list: depends on Pillow (it's untested with PIL)
* Fix pyocr.VERSION

0.1.2 --> 0.2.0:
* Python 3.x support

0.1.1 --> 0.1.2:
* Tesseract: Fix version parsing
* Tesseract: Fix Tesseract 3.02.01's hOCR format support

0.1 --> 0.1.1:
* hOCR: Parse lines as well as words
* tesseract.get_available_languages() : Fix fedora support
* Fix UTF-8 support
